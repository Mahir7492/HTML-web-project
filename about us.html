        <h2>Why does the Audi logo have four rings?</h2>
        <p>
            Logo? Of course! That’s what the Auto Union AG thought<br>when it was founded nearly 90 years ago, too. How four<br>companies became four rings — and, ultimately, the global<br>brand AUDI AG. And why sand painting is so important in<br>the process of logo design.
